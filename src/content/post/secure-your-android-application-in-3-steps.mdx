# Why should you care about security?

In today's digital age, developers face **increasing challenges** with **cybersecurity threats** and relentless hackers. To fortify your application's defenses, employ these three simple yet effective tricks that can significantly impede attackers and enhance your app's security posture.

Summary: Do you think your application is secure? Numbers say it isn't, Here is how to fix security.

## Emulator detection

What is an emulator? An emulator is a special program or device that copies the way one computer system works so that software designed for that system can run on a different one. Emulator detection is a security technique that helps figure out if a program is running on an emulator or a real device, which makes the system more secure and trustworthy.

Here is a tool that can help you implement this feature. ➡️ [Link](https://github.com/strazzere/anti-emulator/tree/master/slides)

## Root detection

Root detection is crucial for app security, as rooted devices can bypass security measures and potentially compromise sensitive data. However, with the proliferation of root bypass methods, relying solely on one root detection check has become ineffective. To maintain the integrity of your app, it's essential to adopt a multi-layered approach that combines various root detection techniques

### There are 3 main tools you could use:

1. Root Inspector is a powerful GitHub project that provides an easy-to-use interface for analyzing and inspecting root files in various operating systems. ➡️ [Link](https://github.com/devadvance/rootinspector)

2. Free rasp is a comprehensive GitHub project that offers a collection of libraries and tools for detecting and managing root access on Android devices. They have a well documented step by step instructions. ➡️ [Link](https://github.com/talsec/Free-RASP-Android)

3. Root Beer is a new tool used to secure your application in various ways against rooting. There are 9 checkups the tool uses to spot a rooted device. ➡️ [Link](https://github.com/scottyab/rootbeer)

## There is always 2 options, the easy or the hard way?

You could try implementing and learning these vulnerabilities alone, struggle and maybe not even know what more vulnerabilities you have on your applications. Or you could book your free penetration test that lasts untill 8th July. Your chooise, your time. Book here ⬇️
